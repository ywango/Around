This is the web service part of Nearby project, please see the IOS part for IOS development.
See below for brief introduction of the whole project:

Developed an iOS app for users to post and search events nearby without being affected by web spam(eg. Ads, etc.)
-  Built a web service in Go to handle posts and keyword based spam detection
-  Used ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide Geo-Index based search functions within a distance given by user(eg. 200km)
-  Deployed the service to Google Cloud (GAE flex) for better scaling and created Bigtable for persistent posts storage
-  Used Google Dataflow to implement a daily dump of posts to BigQuery table for offline analysis
